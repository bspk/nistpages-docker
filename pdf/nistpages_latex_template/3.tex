%	Author Order and Grouping. Always identify the primary author/creator first (s/he does not have to be a NIST author).
%   For publications with multiple authors, group authors by their organizational affiliation.
%   The organizational groupings and the names within each grouping should generally be ordered by decreasing level of contribution.
%	For non-NIST authors, list their city and state below their organization name.
%	For NIST authors, include the Division and Laboratory names (but do not include their city and state).
